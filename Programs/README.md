# Programs

Experimental scripts and Slurm drivers live here. The `Reordering` and `Multiplication` folders hold wrapper scripts for each technique or kernel listed in `TOOLS.md`.

Runtime paths are also configured in `exp_config.sh`.  Set the `MATRIX_DIR`
and `RESULTS_DIR` environment variables before sourcing it if you want to
store the dataset or experiment output outside the repository.
