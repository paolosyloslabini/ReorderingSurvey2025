# ReorderingSurvey2025

This repository hosts an experimental framework for studying how matrix reordering affects sparse multiplication performance. The high-level design is described in `AGENTS.md`.

## Repository Layout
- `Raw_Matrices/` – download of original matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection.
- `Programs/` – Slurm drivers and wrapper scripts for each reordering technique or multiplication kernel.
- `Results/` – output CSVs and permutation files generated by the pipeline.
- `scripts/` – helper utilities such as dataset bootstrap and CSV post-processing.
- `config/` – YAML files describing available techniques and parameter sets.
- `logs/` – Slurm job output.

See `TODO.md` for the current development status and upcoming tasks.

## Configuration
Paths to the raw matrices and where results should be written are defined in
`Programs/exp_config.sh`. By default they resolve to directories under the
repository root, but they can be overridden by setting the `RAW_MATRIX_DIR` and
`RESULTS_DIR` environment variables before running the pipeline.
