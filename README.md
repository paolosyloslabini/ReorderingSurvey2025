# ReorderingSurvey2025

This repository hosts an experimental framework for studying how matrix reordering affects sparse multiplication performance. The high-level design is described in `AGENTS.md`.

## Repository Layout
- `Raw_Matrices/` – download of original matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection.
- `Programs/` – Slurm drivers and wrapper scripts for each reordering technique or multiplication kernel.
- `Results/` – output CSVs and permutation files generated by the pipeline.
- `scripts/` – helper utilities such as dataset bootstrap and CSV post-processing.
- `config/` – YAML files describing available techniques and parameter sets.
- `logs/` – Slurm job output.

See `TODO.md` for the current development status and upcoming tasks.

## Customizing Data Locations

By default the matrices and experiment results reside under `Raw_Matrices/` and
`Results/` inside the repository.  Large deployments can place these folders
elsewhere by exporting `MATRIX_DIR` and `RESULTS_DIR` before sourcing
`Programs/exp_config.sh`.

## Installing Reordering Techniques

Run `scripts/bootstrap.sh` to fetch external reorderers. Build them after
loading the necessary modules on your cluster. Rabbit Order (`ro`) requires
`g++` (≥ 4.9.2), `Boost` (≥ 1.58.0), `libnuma` (≥ 2.0.9), and
`libtcmalloc_minimal` from `gperftools` (≥ 2.1); see
`Programs/Reordering/Techniques/README.md` for detailed commands.

## Python Environment

Helper scripts such as `csv_helper.py` rely on `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`,
`python-graphblas`, and `py-metis`. Clusters often forbid `pip` or `sudo`, so
make these packages available via the module system or by building them in a
local prefix.

The `requirements.txt` file enumerates the Python packages that need to be
present; satisfy them using modules or local builds.

## Example Slurm Run

Each driver now handles a single matrix, technique, and parameter set. Submit
multiple jobs to sweep over inputs.

### Reordering

```bash
# Reorder with Rabbit Order in cluster mode
sbatch Programs/Reorder.sbatch Raw_Matrices/TEST/matrix.mtx ro mode=cluster
```

### Multiplication

```bash
# Multiply the reordered matrix with a given kernel
sbatch --dependency=afterok:<REORDER_JOBID> \
       Programs/Multiply.sbatch \
       Results/Reordering/TEST/matrix/ro_mode-cluster/results.csv \
       cusparse alpha=1.0
```

The `mult_impl` argument selects a wrapper script from
`Programs/Multiplication/Techniques/`.
