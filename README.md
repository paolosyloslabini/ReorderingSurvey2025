# ReorderingSurvey2025

This repository hosts an experimental framework for studying how matrix reordering affects sparse multiplication performance. The high-level design is described in `AGENTS.md`.

## Repository Layout
- `Raw_Matrices/` – download of original matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection.
- `Programs/` – Slurm drivers and wrapper scripts for each reordering technique or multiplication kernel.
- `Results/` – output CSVs and permutation files generated by the pipeline.
- `scripts/` – helper utilities such as dataset bootstrap and CSV post-processing.
- `config/` – YAML files describing available techniques and parameter sets.
- `logs/` – Slurm job output.

See `TODO.md` for the current development status and upcoming tasks.

## Customizing Data Locations

By default the matrices and experiment results reside under `Raw_Matrices/` and
`Results/` inside the repository.  Large deployments can place these folders
elsewhere by exporting `MATRIX_DIR` and `RESULTS_DIR` before sourcing
`Programs/exp_config.sh`.

## Installing Reordering Techniques

Run `scripts/bootstrap.sh` to fetch and build external reorderers. Detailed
instructions for each tool are found in `Programs/Reordering/Techniques/README.md`.

## Python Environment

Helper scripts such as `csv_helper.py` rely on SciPy's sparse matrix
functions. Create a virtual environment and install the Python
dependencies before running the pipeline:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file lists `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`,
`suitesparsegraphblas`, and `py-metis`.
