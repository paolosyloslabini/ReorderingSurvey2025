# Raw_Matrices

This directory will contain the unmodified matrices fetched from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection. The contents are static after the initial download and should not be versioned with Git if large. The pipeline reads matrices from the location specified by `RAW_MATRIX_DIR` in `Programs/exp_config.sh`, which defaults to this folder.
