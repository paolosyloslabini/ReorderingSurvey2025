Helper utilities and setup scripts. `bootstrap.sh` installs third-party
reorderers. `csv_helper.py` merges structural metrics into the results and
uses SciPy for sparse matrix computations. Install the Python packages
listed in `requirements.txt` before invoking these scripts:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
